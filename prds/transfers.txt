Motivation:
First time ran into a situation where player is carrying down the basket and shouldâ€™ve stopped at the checkpoint to not run a risk of ending on deterrent and falling!
Gave me a reason for wanting to advance other pieces to form a connection and transferring the basket rather than taking the risk on going solo!

Functionality:
A new option to transfer the basket to another piece before rolling the dice.
Basket can be transferred to another piece that is:
1. adjacent on same or different lane OR
2. diagonally 1 step away on a different lane
Chain transfer: Basket can be transferred multiple times before rolling the dice.
