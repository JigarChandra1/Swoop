SWOOP — Rulebook (Print & Play / Pass & Play)
A 2–4 player, push-your-luck race about Monkeys, Seagulls, Crabs, and Turtles stealing baskets and sprinting home — now with shared lanes, push chains, and token-based Swoops.
1) Summary
Players: 2–4 (Monkeys • Seagulls • Crabs • Turtles)
Goal: Deliver baskets to your shore. First to the agreed score wins (recommended 5).
Core Loop: Roll 4d6 → choose a pair (up to two disjoint pairs per roll) → Move. You may also spend Swoop tokens to make a sideways jump. Push your luck until you Bank, or you Bust.
2) Components
Board showing 11 lanes labeled 2–12 converging at the center. Lanes are shared by both players.
Baskets sit at the center tops of even lanes.
Per player: 5 pieces (max 5 on the board at once).
Swoop tokens: only the final seat begins with 1 token; all others start at 0. Tokens are capped at 2 per player.
4 six‑sided dice.
3) Board Anatomy
Lanes are different lengths. Steps count from each shore toward the center (step 1 is the shore; the highest step L is just below the center).
Shared lanes: There is only one cell per lane step for both players — only one piece can occupy a cell at a time.
Adjacent lanes: each lane neighbors its immediate lower and higher sum (e.g., 6 is adjacent to 5 and 7).

3.2 Special cells (by lane length L)
Checkpoints: at 2, (4 if L≥6), and L‑1.
Deterrents: at 3 and L‑2 (and 5 on lanes 6/8 when L≥5).
Special cells never overlap; if one would, the board prefers the checkpoint.
Theme: Checkpoints are safe resting spots; Deterrents are hazards you only suffer when your turn ends.
4) Setup
Place the board between players with Monkeys on the left shore and Seagulls on the right shore (both approach the center).
Put basket icons at the center of all even lanes (2/4/6/8/10/12).
Each player takes 5 pieces; all off‑board.
Give Swoop tokens: only the final seat begins with 1 token; everyone else stays at 0. Tokens are capped at 2.
Agree on a target score (default 5).
5) Turn Structure
On your turn:
A) Pre‑roll — You may Bank (Stop) before rolling (details in §7), otherwise roll.
B) Roll — Roll 4 dice.
C) Choose pairs — Select one pair to act on now. The two unused dice form a forced second pair you may optionally act on in the same roll.
D) Act — Spend a pair to Move (see §6.1). At any time during your turn, you may spend a Swoop token to Swoop with an active piece (see §6.2). You must take at least one Move if possible; the second pair is optional. Then you may roll again and repeat, until you Bank or Bust.
6) Actions
6.1 Move (pair sum → lane)
If you have no piece on that sum’s lane this turn: start a piece at step 1 on that lane and mark it active (see §8).
If you already have a piece on that lane: choose direction — Up (+1 toward center) or Down (−1 toward home).
Top‑step sidestep: From the top step (step L) you may instead move sideways to the adjacent lane’s top step. This is part of Move (not a Swoop) and costs no token.
Pickup: Reaching the top step of an even lane instantly picks up its basket (if available) and flips that piece to returning.
Push (shared‑lane collisions):
• If a Move or Swoop would land on an occupied cell (yours or opponent’s), the occupying piece is pushed exactly 1 cell “away” in the direction of the approach. This can chain across multiple pieces.
• Pushing off the board: If a push would go past step 1 (toward home) or past step L (toward the center), that pushed piece is removed. If it was carrying, its basket immediately returns to that lane’s top step.
• One piece per cell is always maintained after all pushes resolve.
6.2 Swoop (token‑based sideways move)
Spend 1 Swoop token to choose any one of your active pieces and shift it to an adjacent lane (sum±1):
• Normal case: Land at the same step (capped by the target lane’s length).
• Odd‑lane top slope: If starting from step (L‑1) on an odd lane (3/5/7/9/11), adjust the landing step by: 3/11 → +1; 5/7/9 → −1 (cap to the adjacent lane’s valid range).
• Top‑step sidestep is part of Move and does not cost a token (§6.1).
• Push resolves if the landing cell is occupied (chain/offs).
• Swoop tokens are not tied to the dice pair and can be used even when no Moves are available, as long as an active piece has a legal Swoop.
7) Ending Your Turn
Your turn ends in one of two ways.
7.1 Bank (Stop)
You may Bank at any time on your turn (including between your first and optional second pair in a 4‑dice roll). Banking locks in progress safely:
• Outward pieces (not carrying) slide down to the nearest checkpoint ≤ their current step on their lane. If there is no checkpoint behind them (e.g., at step 1), that piece falls off the board.
• Returning pieces (carrying baskets) do not slide.
• Deterrents trigger now: any piece on a deterrent is removed. If it was carrying, its basket returns to the lane’s top.
• Deliveries: each carrying piece at step 1 delivers: +1 point, then remove the piece.
• Earn 1 Swoop token (max 2). Tokens are never gained on a Bust.
• Deactivate all your pieces; pass turn.
7.2 Bust — after rolling, you cannot act
You Bust if, given your roll: no pair can make a legal Move and no piece can Swoop legally (i.e., you have no usable token Swoops). If at least one pair can Move, you must take at least one Move this roll before you may Bank.
On a Bust, apply Deterrents/Deliveries/Deactivate (no Bank sliding, no token gain).
8) Active Pieces (per‑turn limit)
You may have at most 2 active pieces (i.e., 2 lanes “in play”) during your current turn.
A lane becomes active when you start or move its piece this turn.
Only active pieces can Swoop.
All pieces become inactive at end of your turn.
9) Additional Rules & Edge Cases
Max pieces on board: 5 per player. If you already have 5, you cannot spawn.
White/blank cells at the extreme ends are visual padding only. Use only the colored lane tiles.
Shared occupancy: If a Move or Swoop targets an occupied cell, pushing resolves the conflict (no illegal “blocked” lands).
Basket scarcity: Each even lane holds at most 1 basket at a time. If a carrying piece is removed, that basket reappears at the lane’s top step.
Turn order: Monkeys start by default (feel free to randomize). Only the final seat keeps swoop tokens (max 2); all other seats reset to 0 after each turn.
No Tailwind: There is no opponent reaction after Swoops.
10) Scoring & Winning
Delivery = 1 point.
First to the agreed score wins (5 recommended). For shorter games: 3. For long sessions: 7.
11) Strategy Notes (optional)
Use token Swoops to escape bad rolls or reposition onto even lanes.
Checkpoints are your safety net — Bank when your outward lanes are exposed to Deterrents.
Push chains can open lanes or eject blockers — plan vectors that favor you.
12) Glossary
Lane: One route labeled 2–12.
Step: Distance from shore; increases toward center; L is the top step.
Checkpoint: Safe tile; outward pieces slide back to it on Bank.
Deterrent: Hazard tile; removes a piece on Bank/Bust.
Basket: Pickup at the top of even lanes; carried pieces move home.
Swoop token: A resource you can spend to shift an active piece to an adjacent lane.
Push: Forced displacement of an occupant when a Move/Swoop lands on its cell (can chain; off‑board pieces are removed; baskets return).
Active piece: A lane you’ve engaged this turn (max 2).
Basket: Pickup at the top of even lanes; carried pieces move home.
Swoop: Sideways shift to an adjacent lane; may include odd-lane slope (↑/↓) at the top.
Active piece: A lane you’ve engaged this turn (max 2).
