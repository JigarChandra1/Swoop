SWOOP — Rulebook (Print & Play / Pass & Play)
A 2-player, push-your-luck race about Monkeys and Seagulls stealing baskets and sprinting home.
1) Summary
Players: 2 (Monkeys vs Seagulls)
Goal: Deliver baskets to your shore. First to the agreed score wins (recommended 5).
Core Loop: Roll 3d6 → pick any pair → Move or Swoop. Push your luck until you Bank, or you Bust.
2) Components
Board showing 11 lanes labeled 2–12 from both shores, converging at the center.
Baskets sit at the center tops of even lanes.
Per player: 5 pieces (you may have at most 5 on the board).
3 six-sided dice.
Tokens are optional for Checkpoints/Deterrents (board usually prints them).
3) Board Anatomy
Lanes are different lengths. Steps count from each shore toward the center (step 1 is the shore; the highest step is just below the center).
No stacking: Only one piece per cell—ever.
Adjacent lanes: each lane neighbors its immediate lower and higher sum (e.g., 6 is adjacent to 5 and 7).

3.2 Special cells (by lane length L)
Checkpoints: at 2, (4 if L≥6), and L-1.
Deterrents: at 3 and L-2 (and 5 on lanes 6/8 when L≥5).
Special cells never overlap; if one rule would overlap another, the board uses the checkpoint.
Theme: Checkpoints are safe resting spots; Deterrents are hazards you only suffer when your turn ends.
4) Setup
Place the board between players with Monkeys on the left shore and Seagulls on the right shore (both approach the center).
Put basket icons at the center of all even lanes (2/4/6/8/10/12).
Each player takes 5 pieces; all off-board.
Agree on a target score (default 5).
5) Turn Structure
On your turn:
A) Pre-roll
You may Bank (Stop) before rolling (details in §7).
Otherwise, press on to Roll.
B) Roll
Roll 3 dice.
C) Choose any pair of the three dice
The unused die is ignored.
D) Spend that pair to do one of:
Move (the pair’s sum lane), or
Swoop (sideways, pair used as “energy”, not as a sum).
Then you may roll again and repeat, until you Bank or Bust.
6) Actions
6.1 Move (pair sum → “your lane”)
If you have no piece on that sum’s lane this turn:
Start a piece on your shore at step 1 on that lane and mark it active (see §8).
That spend does not advance it yet; it merely claims the lane for this turn.
If you already have a piece on that lane:
Advance it +1 step toward the center (if returning with a basket, it moves −1 step toward home).
Blockers: You cannot move if the destination cell is occupied.
Pickup: Reaching the top step of an even lane instantly picks up its basket (if available) and flips that piece to returning.
Delivery: Delivery never happens during Move; see End of Turn (§7).
6.2 Swoop (sideways)
Choose any active piece (yours) and shift it to an adjacent lane (sum±1), landing at the same step if possible.
Odd-lane top slope: If the piece starts the Swoop from step (L-1) on an odd lane (3/5/7/9/11), apply:
3 → +1 step, 11 → +1 step
5/7/9 → −1 step
(Cap to that adjacent lane’s valid range.)
No stacking: Illegal if the destination cell is occupied.
Tailwind (immediate reaction by opponent):
Opponent chooses one of:
Advance +1 any one of their pieces (respecting direction and blocking), or
Spawn a new piece at step 1 on any lane (if they have < 5 pieces total and the cell is free).
If no legal Tailwind is possible, nothing happens.
7) Ending Your Turn
Your turn ends in one of two ways.
7.1 Bank (Stop) — only before you roll
You lock in progress safely:
Outward pieces (not carrying baskets) slide down to the nearest checkpoint ≤ their current step on their lane.
If there is no checkpoint behind them (e.g., at step 1), that piece falls off the board.
Returning pieces (carrying baskets) do not slide.
Deterrents trigger now:
Any piece on a deterrent is removed.
If it was carrying, its basket is returned to the center of that lane.
Deliveries:
Each carrying piece at step 1 delivers: +1 point, then remove the piece.
Deactivate all your pieces; pass turn.
7.2 Bust — after rolling, you cannot act
You Bust if, given your roll:
No pair can make a legal Move and
No piece can Swoop legally.
On a Bust, skip steps 1–2 above and apply steps 3–5 (Deterrents, Deliveries, Deactivate).
8) Active Pieces (per-turn limit)
You may have at most 2 active pieces (i.e., 2 lanes “in play”) during your current turn.
A lane becomes active when you start or move its piece this turn.
You can only Swoop with active pieces.
All pieces become inactive at end of your turn.
9) Additional Rules & Edge Cases
Max pieces on board: 5 per player. If you already have 5, you cannot spawn (even via Tailwind).
White/blank cells at the extreme ends are visual padding only. Only the colored lane tiles (including plain grey) are usable spaces.
Blockers: If a move would land on an occupied cell, the move is illegal.
Basket scarcity: Each even lane holds at most 1 basket at a time. If a carrying piece is removed, that basket reappears at the center top of its lane.
Turn order: Monkeys start by default (feel free to randomize).
Sportsmanship: If multiple legal Tailwind choices exist, the opponent chooses one; if their chosen +1 is blocked, it simply does nothing.
10) Scoring & Winning
Delivery = 1 point.
First to the agreed score wins (5 recommended).
For shorter games: 3. For long sessions: 7.
11) Strategy Notes (optional)
Use early Swoops to reposition onto even lanes; let Tailwind “wake” the opponent on awkward lanes.
Checkpoints are your safety net—Bank when your lanes are exposed to Deterrents.
When returning, prioritize unblocked paths; a single blocker can force a detour via Swoop.
12) Glossary
Lane: One route labeled 2–12.
Step: Distance from shore; increases toward center.
Checkpoint: Safe tile; outward pieces slide back to it on Bank.
Deterrent: Hazard tile; removes a piece on Bank/Bust.
Basket: Pickup at the top of even lanes; carried pieces move home.
Swoop: Sideways shift to an adjacent lane; may include odd-lane slope (↑/↓) at the top.
Tailwind: Opponent’s immediate +1 (or spawn) after someone Swoops.
Active piece: A lane you’ve engaged this turn (max 2).
